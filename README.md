# STOCK'EM (APP OVERVIEW)

## API is discontinued and the application is now on work in progress

Forecasting risk in stock trading is truly important for Stock Investors, potential investors, and everyone who is interested in stocks. If you have invested in stocks should always look for the ways how to detect sudden price changes and take immediate actions to protect your investments.
For that reason, we have created an application that informs users real-time stock data in order to increase awareness on price changes. After registration, users can create as many portfolios as they want and add as many stocks to these portfolios.

## Instructions

1. Sign-Up/Sign-In
2. After you sign-in or sign-up, go to 'PROFILE' and click 'CREATE A PORTFOLIO' to create a portfolio.
3. Once you created a Portfolio, you can start adding stocks into them.
4. You will have to search the company by ticker(example: yahoo = yhoo, tesla = tsla, google = googl)
5. After you added few stocks into your portfolio, you can browse each stocks.
6. To browse a single company that you have added into your portfolio, simply click 'view'.
7. When you browse a single data, you can use the chart to see the company's historical data.
